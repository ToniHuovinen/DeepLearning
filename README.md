# DeepLearning
Some Deeplearning models done with Python. All datasets here are public and quite popular among the machine learning/ deep learning community and are commonly used in models.

Coded with Anaconda/Spyder. You need to have tensorflow, keras, numpy, sklearn and pandas installed for these models to work on your system.

Diabetes - Simple ANN Classification task to predict if the person in dataset has diabetes or not. You can easily enter new information into the model to predict new results.
Column info: Number of times pregnant, Plasma glucose concentration, Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), Triceps skin fold thickness (mm), 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2), Diabetes pedigree function, Age (years), Class variable (0 or 1)

Iris SOM - Self Organizing Map made with Iris flower dataset. With SOM's you can visualize and cluster multidimensional data in 2D way. Iris Flower set consists of 150 flowers, 50 flowers in each Iris species. Two of the species are similar to each other in features, and the third species in the set differs vastly. It should be quite clear when visualized.
